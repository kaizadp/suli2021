## SULI2021 summer project

## Data from TES-Drought project
## Investigating chemical (FTICR-MS, NMR) and microbial (16S) responses to drought.


## Soil cores were collected from Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed, CPCRW (Alaska) and Secret River, SR (WA). 
## The "drought" cores were air dried and then incubated under drought conditions for 150 days.
## The "timezero" cores were deconstructed and processed at the start of the incubation.

## We will use the FTICRRR and NMRRR workflows to investigate shifts in the chemical profile for timezero vs. drought


# 1. FTICR-MS
## plot Van Krevelen graphs to describe the chemical composition for TZ and drought samples
## which peaks were lost or gained during the drought? use Van Krevelen plots to report this.
## calculate relative abundances of the different compound classes
### -> report as table and bar graphs
## perform statistical analyses to determine if Drought and Site had strong influences on chemical composition
### -> PERMANOVA and PCA on multivariate data
### -> ANOVA on univariate data (each individual class)

# 2. NMR
## we do not have much NMR data for the drought samples, only the TZ
## calculate relative abundances of the different compound classes
### -> report as table and bar graphs
## perform statistical analyses to determine if Site had strong influences on chemical composition oif TZ samples
### -> PERMANOVA and PCA on multivariate data
### -> ANOVA on univariate data (each individual class)

## How do the FTICR and NMR data compare to each other?
